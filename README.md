# Ball Bouncing Simulation

## Overview
This Python script simulates the motion of a ball bouncing in the presence of air resistance and gravity. It includes interactions with a floor and a vertical wall. The simulation determines the optimal initial velocity for a given launch angle that minimizes the ball's deviation from its starting height upon return.

## Features
- Simulates projectile motion with air resistance.
- Models collisions with the ground and a vertical wall.
- Finds the optimal initial velocity for a given launch angle.
- Provides an animation of the ball's trajectory.

## Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` for visualization and animation.
- `os` for clearing the terminal.
- `math` for trigonometric and mathematical functions.

## Output
- A plot showing the ball's trajectory, the ground, and the vertical wall.
- An animation illustrating the motion.

## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment and enter the requested parameters when prompted.
